`swe` is a command-line interface to the great Swedish-English dictionary "[Folkets lexikon](https://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/folkets/om.en.html)". It works 100% offline. Users can explore translations, idioms, synonoms and more. It can also be used for finding words containing specific substrings, and for listening to the pronunciations of words.

## Installation
`swe` is a Python script with zero dependecies. Place the swe.py somewhere in your $PATH and you should be good to go. For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bjesus/swe.git
$ sudo cp swe/swe.py /usr/bin/swe
$ chmod +x /usr/bin/swe
$ swe ord
```

### Zsh Completion

The repository includes a Zsh completion file [_swe](_swe) to enhance the user experience by enabling word auto-completion.

To enable Zsh completion, do the following:

```
$ cp swe/_swe ~/.zsh/completion/_swe
$ chmod +x ~/.zsh/completion/_swe
```

You will need to restart Zsh for the changes to take effect.

## Usage
1. `swe -s ord` - Print all words containing the specified substring ("ord" in this example).
2. `swe ord` - Print the translation for the specified word
3. `swe` - Play the sound of the latest translated word
